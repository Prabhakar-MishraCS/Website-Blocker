# Website-Blocker
The script tries to block the websites mentioned in the list based on the time which we have set as the working hours. After the specified time duration it automatically unblocks the website.

While executing don't run the script directly from your favourite IDE, since access to host file, requires an admin privelage.

Steps for Executing the Script:

 1. Open your terminal
 2. Type 'sudo python3 main.py"
 3. Type your password
